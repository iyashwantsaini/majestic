Why GSoC with FOSSology? 

I have always been interested in working with new technologies and developing 

applications for various platforms. FOSSology is the premier free software system for 

licence scanning and many companies rely on FOSSology on a weekly basis for 

their work. Improving FOSSology will help the community and these companies in 

getting their work done easily. This project is about creating an FOSSology server 

job dashboard and I believe I am the perfect match for working on this project. 

Synopsis 

FOSSology is an open source license compliance software system and toolkit. As a 

toolkit you can run license, copyright and export control scans from the command 

line. As a system, a database and web ui are provided to give you a compliance 

workflow. In one click you can generate an SPDX file, or a ReadMe with the 

copyrights notices from your software. Many companies rely on FOSSology on a 

weekly basis for their work. 

Problems Faced 

FOSSology has a dashboard, but that is more for the data. In fact, if FOSSology runs 

as a server for multiple users. There are many jobs around. Depending on the 

utilisation, there are a number of packages scanned and analysed and therefore 

plenty of jobs in the queue.  

Now comes the problem: FOSSology currently allows us to view our own jobs only or 

jobs with access rights for the referring upload. While this is consistent in terms of 

access restrictions, a normal user does not understand what is going on the 

Fossology server and why their own tasks are taking time to be processed. Impatient

users submit jobs again and again until they see some progress. But in fact they 

have worsened the Job situation.  

The current job dashboard is shown below :  

 

Project Goals

● Ability to see what other users are doing. 

● Better list, sort and filter capabilities than current job view 

● Improvement in UI and replacement of flat tables. 

○ Enhancement or replacement in the current tabular based job view

Benefits to Community 

Implementation of the job dashboard with new features will benefit the community in 

many ways : 

● Users will now have a good understanding of how the tasks are being handled 

by the FOSSology server.  

● They will know whether their or someone else’s job is currently being run by 

the server.  

● This will prevent users from getting impatient and submitting their jobs again 

and again. 

● Improvements in UI will help attract more users. 

Deliverables 

● Added functionality of viewing tasks currently in queue. 

● Added functionality of which tasks are being processed by users. 

● Added functionality of viewing what other users are doing. 

● Better list, sort and filter capabilities than current job view 

● Improved UI of the job dashboard. 

Future Goals 

● Explore the possibility of improving the job dashboard.

Commitments 

How much time will you be able to contribute to this project? 

I will be working 6-8 hours per day for the entire duration of the project. 

Will you treat Google Summer of Code as a full-time employment? 

Yes 

Do you have any experience using source control e.g. Git? 

Yes, I have been using GitHub for a long time now. I use it for both my institute as 

well as personal projects. 

Any previous open-source projects you have contributed to? 

This is my first time in GSoC. I have already learned a-lot about the open source culture 

and how they work in a professional way. I would be very excited to learn more. It would 

be a great opportunity for me to expand my skills while still contributing to open-source. 

This can be the starting point for me for seriously getting into and truly appreciating the 

concept of Open-Source. Most of my projects are on my Git-Hub profile.  

Do you plan to have any other commitments during GSoC that may 

affect your work? 

I do not have any commitments that would affect my work in any way. I have not applied 

for any other internships/ part-time / full-time jobs. I have 24/7 internet connectivity, as 

<div class="annotation"><a href="http://analyticware.in/">http://analyticware.in/</a>

well as access to personal laptop. I have no trips / vacations planned irrespective of GSoC 

or not. 

How do we contact you for questions, comments, suggestions, etc.? 

I am perfectly fine with Email, Skype, IRC or any other similar medium of 

communication. My preferred language for communication is English. 

Skype : @yashsn2127 

Email : yashsn2127@gmail.com 

Do you plan on contributing to our project after GSoC is over? 

I would definitely like to continue my contributions even after GSoC.
