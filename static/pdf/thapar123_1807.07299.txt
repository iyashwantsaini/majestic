We investigate the employment of carefully selected solvent additives in the processing of a 

commercial perovskite precursor ink and analyze their impact on the performance of 

organometal trihalide perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3−xClx) photovoltaic devices. We  provide 

evidence that the use of benzaldehyde can be used as an effective method to preserve the 

stoichiometry of the perovskite precursors in solution. Benzaldehyde based additive 

engineering shows to improve perovskite solid state film morphology and device performance 

of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx  based solar cells.  

 

THE MANUSCRIPT 

Earth-abundant organic-inorganic trihalide perovskites possess excellent optoelectronic 

properties and have been successfully implemented in a wide range of applications, including 

light emitting diodes, sensors and photovoltaic devices.1 Their general structure is ABX3, 

where A is an organic cation, B a divalent metal ion and X a Cl, Br, I or any mixture of these 

halides. The countless composition combinations offer the possibility of tuning important

properties such as the energy band gap or the stability of the resulting photoactive layers.2 

Indeed, compositional engineering is one of the main strategies used to boost device 

performance.3–5 High quality perovskite layers can be obtained by properly controlling the 

crystal growth.6,7 However, some of the most commonly used precursors as well as the 

resulting perovskite layers tend to decompose upon exposure to humidity and high temperature, 

even under material encapsulation.8 Unstable perovskite precursors impede a precise control 

of the stoichiometry to yield high quality films. This is even more severe in the case of mixed 

halides, where the ratio of the precursors can be critical.9 On the other hand, solvent engineering 

and the use of additives have also contributed meaningfully to the field.10–14 

In this work we examine the effect of solvent additives engineering on the morphology, 

optoelectronic properties and solar cell device performance of solution processed 

methylammonium lead mixed iodide-chloride perovskites (CH3NH3PbI3-xClx) photovoltaics. 

Noteworthy, we use a commercial precursor ink containing methylammounium iodide (MAI), 

PbCl2 and PbI2 at a molar ratio of 1:1:4 (PbCl2:PbI2:MAI) in anhydrous N,N-

dimethylformamide (DMF). Importantly, in order to produce a representative study we employ 

a set of the following criteria to select the appropriate solvent additives: i) inclusion of both 

higher and lower polarity solvents compared to the reference host DMF solvent, ii) use of 

higher boiling point (bp) solvents than DMF (bp 153 °C), while iii) keeping high enough vapour 

pressure to ensure a complete solvent removal during perovskite film formation at low 

temperature (80 °C) and iv) different nucleophilic strength and/or reducing character. The 

selected additives are: 1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene (aka tetralin), γ-valerolactone, 

acetophenone, furfural, benzaldehyde, N-methylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and 

benzylamine (see Table I).

A detailed description of the perovskite film preparation, device fabrication15 and the 

morphological and optical characterization can be found in the supplementary material. As 

shown in Fig. 1, the addition of small amounts (1-5% vol) of these solvents into the precursor 

ink yielded a set of perovskite layers with distinct morphological characteristics. Some of the 

additives used, namely tetralin, acetophenone, γ-valerolactone and N-methylformamide, do not 

seem to have a clear influence on crystal size. On the other hand, scanning electron microscopy 

(SEM) revealed significant modifications in crystal size, shape and surface coverage (Fig. 1) 

upon the inclusion of the other additives. The case of DMSO deserves a special mention, as its 

ability to form the PbI2(DMSO)2 complex has been used to retard the crystallization process 

and modify the crystal size.10,16,17 A dense layer of small perovskite crystals was obtained with 

1% vol. of DMSO, larger crystals and formation of pinholes were visible at the level of 3% vol. 

additive while incorporation of 5% vol of DMSO yielded significantly larger crystals with a 

very poor surface coverage. The wide variation in the microstructure within the small range of 

DMSO additive employed provides evidence for the critical role of the amount of additives in 

the structural properties of the perovskite solids. Similarly, the crystal size increased with 

increasing additive content for benzaldehyde and furfural, though in this case the dense film 

packing appears unaffected by the additive treatment. Importantly, the addition of only 1% vol. 

of benzylamine resulted in the formation of large cuboid-shaped crystals, which could be

related to the changes in stoichiometry discussed later in the text. UV-Vis absorbance and 

relevant Tauc plots indicate that the additive treatment has a minor (maximum shift of 5 meV 

compared to the reference DMF solvent) and non-systematic influence on the material energy 

band gap, with the exception of benzylamine where a ~20 meV red-shift is observed  (Fig. S1). 

This moderate change could be related to lattice structural distortions derived from a modified 

stoichiometry in the perovskite film formation.18 A more accurate X/Pb stoichiometric ratio 

would reduce the amount of defects in the perovskite layer. 

The photovoltaic efficiency measurements under calibrated AM 1.5G irradiation 

conditions performed for several identical experimental device fabrication runs reveal a 

consistent trend (Fig. 2): the maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) corresponds 

systematically to the devices prepared with the benzaldehyde additive. Regardless of its content, 

the use of benzaldehyde was beneficial for the device performance, systematically improving 

by a factor of 10% the PCE of the control devices (from an average of 11% to 12%), with a 

13.5% record device. The improvement appears to be mostly a consequence of an increased 

photocurrent, with a minor enhancement in the fill factor (Fig. S2). Furthermore, the initial 

stability test of those solar cells is increased by more than a threefold factor i.e. from 200 h to 

650 h of operational lifetime (T80) under the ISOS-D-1 protocol. We attribute the 

improvements to a better perovskite solid state film formation  induced by the benzaldehyde 

treatment. The microscopy data shown within Fig. 1 provides indication that the treatment with 

benzaldehyde improves the perovskite active layer morphology compared to the untreated  

original ink. 

In the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx  based formulation under investigation we did not observe any 

clear correlation between the perovskite film morphology nor the device performance with the 

polarity, boiling point and vapor pressure of the additives tested. Even so, the most significant

changes described above were obtained with DMSO, benzylamine and benzaldhyde, three 

solvents whose boiling points are 25-35 °C above that of the host solvent DMF. Therefore we 

can not exclude the relevance of this parameter. Moreover, we believe that further studies  

based on the selection of additives presented here are necessary to fully understand their 

morphological influence of polarity, boiling point and vapor pressure on alternative perovskite 

formulations.  

Based on the results of our preliminary study, the parameter which appears to have a 

measurable impact on the film morphology and device performance is the reducing character 

of the additive. Thus we further explored how the additive reducing character affects the film 

characteristics and in particular the stoichiometry of the perovskite material. For that reason 

we characterized the absorbance of the precursor formulations with increasing additive content 

(Fig. 3). Firstly, the focus was set on the spectral features at 320 nm and 365 nm, corresponding 

to absorption signatures of PbI2 and MAI, respectively.19 It is well known that organic iodides 

such as MAI are not very stable in air and under light irradiation, mainly due to the oxidation 

of I- into I2. By monitoring the PbI2 and MAI features, we aimed to probe potential variations 

in the stoichiometry of the original precursor ink induced by the additives. The resulting spectra 

showed no changes when using tetralin, -valerolactone, DMSO or N-methylformamide 

additives. On the other hand, the PbI2 signal was slightly stronger (weaker) with acetophenone 

and furfural (benzylamine). Finally, both PbI2 and MAI peaks showed a meaningful increase 

upon benzaldehyde treatment. We ascribe this effect to the reducing character of benzaldehyde, 

which appears to prevent the oxidation of the unstable precursors and eventually reduce already 

oxidized components. According to table I,  benzylamine is a stronger reducing agent and thus 

one could expect it to undergo nucleophilic subsitution with the methylammonium cation, 

yielding benzylammonium and thus lowering even further the concentration of MAI. However, 

as shown in Fig. 3 the MAI peak does not diminish upon addition of benzylamine, whereas the

PbI2 signal at 320 nm decreases instead. We could not confirm whether this is due to the 

complexation of Pb with the amine groups. The experimental results however suggest that with 

a low amount (1% vol) of benzylamine only the PbI2 undergoes undesired reactions, while the 

PbCl2 remains unaffected and favor the growth of cuboid shaped perovskite crystals6 (see 

bottom right corner in Fig. 1) instead of the tetragonal-cubic mixture expected in mixed iodide-

chloride perovskites. This is because of the lower ionization energy of iodine (10.45 eV) 

compared with chlorine (12.97 eV). At higher concentrations, the excess amine content might 

also affect the PbCl2, hence the formation of MAI crystallites (top right corner in Fig. 1). Such 

modification in the perovskite crystal structure is plausible origin of the  bathochromic shift of 

the absorption edge observed upon treatment with benzylamine (Fig. S1), as discussed 

previously in the manuscript. 

On the other hand, the milder influence of benzaldehyde appears not to alter the crystal 

structure and at the same time reveals more clear trends in the signatures associated with the 

different oxidation states of iodine (Fig. 3b): the amount of iodide ion I- increases (shoulder at 

193 nm and peak at 248 nm) in relation to I2 (203 nm), whereas the content of the partially 

oxidized triiodide ion I3- decreases (288 nm and 350 nm). It is therefore proven that the 

beneficial effect of adding benzaldehye in the precursor solution stands for its reducing 

properties. Importantly, the fact that this change is observed in solution supports the idea that 

this is an isolated effect rather than a combined action with the boiling point or the vapor 

pressure, which one could expect to have an impact on the drying kinetics during film formation. 

This valuable finding demonstrates that the limiting instability of the perovskite precursors can 

be significantly mitigated by the simple addition of small amounts of specific reducing agents 

such as the herein proposed benzaldehyde. As a result, the modified ink has a higher unreacted 

precursor content compared to the untreated material, which results in the improved perovskite 

microstructure.20 Our results are in good agreement with the work reported by Zhang et al.,

where the addition of hypophosphorous acid as a reducing agent yielded a significantly 

enhanced perovskite microstructure.14 In our case, we believe that the relatively low precursor 

concentration of the untreated commercial ink is responsible for the lower solar cell efficiencies 

achieved with such a material compared to the reported state of the art devices. Furthermore, 

in contrast to the aforementioned work14 we do not observe a consistent enhancement of the 

film PL intensity nor PL lifetime with perovskite crystal size upon addition of the reducing 

additive, as observed in  Fig. S3.  This may be understood as the measured PL lifetime is a 

convolution of non-radiative quenching channels and the radiative decay term that are 

potentially affected by the additive treatment in a competing and complex way. Similarly, 

Liang et al reported a PL lifetime quenching in perovskite films treated by additives, as a result 

of the enhanced crystallization and the more efficient charge transfer to the PEDOT 

interlayer.13 We additionally observe that the MAI to PbI2 ratio increases upon benzaldehyde 

addition. The role of non-stoichiometric precursor ratios is still a controversial topic.21,22 In our 

work, the shifted stoichiometry, with a slight excess of MAI compared to the original ink, might 

also be a contributing factor for the formation of improved quality perovskite films. The 

addition of this solvent appears therefore as a simple way to control the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx  

perovskite morphology and stoichiometry and yield better solar cell device performances for 

the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx  precursor ink. 

In summary, we have investigated the use of solvent additives in a commercial 

CH3NH3PbI3−xClx  ink to modify the morphology and optoelectronic properties of the resulting 

perovskite layers. We have observed a diverse impact on such properties depending on the 

additive used. Crystal size and surface coverage can suffer large variations upon additive 

treatment. Although our results suggest no direct influence of the solvent polarity, boiling point 

and vapor pressure on the properties and device performance of the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx material

used for this investigation,  we beleive that the selection process of the additives used within 

this paper can be interested for further studies on alternative perovskite formulations.  In 

contrast, we provide evidence that some of these additives can effectively modify the precursor 

concentration and stoichiometry in the original perovskite ink. The experimental results 

indicate that the addition of a low amount (1% vol) of benzylamine favor the growth of 

CH3NH3PbI3−xClx cuboid shaped perovskite crystals instead of the tetragonal-cubic mixture 

expected in mixed iodide-chloride perovskites, due to the lower ionization energy of iodine 

versus chloride and the consequent faster interaction of the additive with PbI2. For the 

tetragonal-cubic mixture CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskites studied benzaldehyde showed the 

strongest beneficial morphological effect, which we ascribe mainly to its mild reducing 

character. As a result the power conversion efficiency of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx solar cell devices 

using addition of small amount (1-5% vol) of benzaldehyde additive increased by 10% and the 

accelerated lifetime performance under  ISOS-D-1 conditions is improved.

Materials 

All the perovskite-based films and devices were prepared using a commercial precursor ink 

(I201) from Ossila Ltd. The formulation contains methylammounium iodide (MAI), PbCl2 and 

PbI2 at a molar ratio of 1:1:4 (PbCl2:PbI2:MAI) in anhydrous DMF solvent. The rest of solvents 

used were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. Pre-patterned glass-ITO 

substrates (sheet resistance 4 Ω/sq) were purchased from Psiotec Ltd, PEDOT:PSS from H.C. 

Stark (Clevios P VP Al 4083), PC70BM from Solenne BV and aluminum-doped zinc oxide 

(AZO) ink (N-20X) from Nanograde. 

Fabrication of CH3NH3PbI3-xClx perovskite films 

ITO substrates were cleaned by successive steps using an ultrasonic bath in acetone and 

isopropanol for 10 min each and then heated at 120 °C on a hot plate for 10 minutes 

immediately prior to use. A 40 nm PEDOT:PSS layer was formed by dynamically spin coating 

the ink at 6000 rpm for 30s in air. The substrates were then transferred to a nitrogen filled glove 

box for a 20 min annealing at 120 °C. Small quantities of additives (1%, 3% or 5% vol.) were

added to the commercial perovskite precursor formulation and stirred for 5 min prior to use. 

The perovskite layer was formed on top of PEDOT:PSS by dynamically spin coating the 

modified ink at 4000 rpm for 30 s and subsequent annealing for 2h at 80 °C, resulting in a ca. 

350 nm thick films. 

Fabrication of CH3NH3PbI3-xClx perovskite solar cells 

A more detailed description of the solar cell architecture used in this work can be found 

elsewhere.15 The whole device structure was ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3-

xClx/PC70BM/AZO/Al. To complete the solar cell stack, a 50 mg/mL solution of PC70BM in 

chlorobenzene was dynamically spin coated on the perovskite layer at 1000 rpm for 30s. On 

top of it, the AZO ink was dynamically spin coated at 1000 rpm for 30s to yield ca. 50 nm thick 

films, which were then annealed at 80 °C for 2 min. Finally, 100 nm of Al were thermally 

evaporated through a shadow mask to define the active area (9 mm2) of the devices. A UV-

activated epoxy resin (E131 from Ossila) was used to encapsulate the devices with glass 

coverslips. 

Morphological and optical characterization of perovskite films and precursor 

formulations 

The thicknesses of the layers were determined with a Veeco Dektak 150 profilometer. Scanning 

Electron Microscopy (SEM) measurements were carried out with a Quanta 200 (FEI, Hillsboro, 

Oregon, USA) at various magnifications, 10 kV beam voltage and 3.0 spot size. The SEM 

images were used to correlate morphological features with the additive characteristics. 

Absorbance of the precursor formulations with different additive content were characterized 

with a Shimadzu UV-2700 UV-Vis spectrophotometer. Steady-state PL experiments were 

performed in a Fluorolog- 3 Horiba Jobin Yvon spectrometer based on an iHR320 

monochromator equipped with a visible photomultiplier tube (Horiba TBX-04 module). The 

PL was non-resonantly excited at 375 nm by the line of 5 mW Oxxius laser diode. Time-

resolved PL was measured using a time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) method at 

the same spectrophotometer. The PL was excited by a NanoLED laser diode at 375 nm 

operating at 100 KHz with a pulse FWHM of ∼100 ps. The PL decays were analyzed and line-

fitted using the DAS6 (Horiba Jobin Yvon) software analysis package. All PL data were 

acquired with samples placed in vacuum (∼10−3 mbar) in a custom-made optical vacuum 

chamber.

Perovskite solar cell characterization 
Current versus voltage characteristics were measured with a LIV Functionality Test System 

(Botest Systems GmbH) under calibrated AM 1.5G irradiation on a Newport solar simulator 

(100 mW/cm2). Both forward (short circuit → open circuit) and reverse (open circuit → short 

circuit) scans were measured with 10 mV voltage steps and 40 ms of delay time. A custom 

made shadow mask was used during the measurements to accurately define the device area. 

The ISOS-D-1 protocol was followed to carry out the stability characterization.

Figure S3. a) Photoluminescence (PL) spectra, b) average PL intensity vs. crystal size and c) 
PL transient decays of perovskite films deposited on top of PEDOT:PSS from the original ink 
(control) and with the addition of 5% vol. of benzaldehyde. Triple exponential fits on the 
transient decays gave an average PL lifetime of 103 ns and 82 ns, respectively.
